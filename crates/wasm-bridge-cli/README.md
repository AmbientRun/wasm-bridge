# wasm-bridge-cli

This is a helper crate for `wasm-bridge`, see [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/wasm-bridge)
or the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kajacx/wasm-bridge#wasm-bridge).

## Deprecated

Since wasm-bridge version 0.2.0, this cli tool is "deprecated" and no longer working.

You can instead load component bytes with `Component::new()` on the web directly.
